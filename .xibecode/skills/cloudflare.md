Cloudflare API

To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer to 
how to interact with Cloudflare
, which covers using tools like 
Terraform
 and the 
official SDKs
 to maintain your Cloudflare resources.

Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. 
Create an API token
 to grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with 
API keys
, but these keys have 
several limitations
 that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.

To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to 
My Profile
 → 
API Tokens
 and select 
Create Token
. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our 
API fundamentals
.

Cloudflare offers language software development kits (SDKs) as well as 
curl
 examples to demonstrate how to use the Cloudflare API. The SDK libraries allow you to interact with the Cloudflare API in language-specific syntax and more easily integrate with your existing applications.

Cloudflare currently offers the following SDKs:

Go
 ↗

TypeScript
 ↗

Python
 ↗

When to use cURL vs SDK

There is no definite answer on which you should use. Instead, consider your use case and determine whether cURL or an SDK is the best fit.

Use case

cURL

SDK

Quick testing within the CLI

✅

❌

Use within bash scripts or CI

✅

❌*

Usage from within an existing application or framework

❌

✅

More complex usage where you need to chain together outputs

❌

✅

* It is possible, although not straight forward, to use the SDKs within bash scripts or CI environments with additional runtime dependencies and setup.

Example

The following are examples of how you would query all of the Cloudflare zones you have access to.

With cURL:

Terminal window

curl

 

"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones"

 

\

--header 

"Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;API_TOKEN>"

&#x22;">

With the TypeScript SDK:

JavaScript

const

 

client

 

=

 

new

 

Cloudflare

(

{

  

apiToken

:

 

process

.

env

[

"CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"

 Improved React Server Components support in the Cloudflare Vite plugin 
 
 
 
 
Workers
 
 
 
 
The Cloudflare Vite plugin now integrates seamlessly 
@vitejs/plugin-rsc
 ↗

, the official Vite plugin for 
React Server Components
 ↗

.

A 
childEnvironments
 option has been added to the plugin config to enable using multiple environments within a single Worker.
The parent environment can then import modules from a child environment in order to access a separate module graph.
For a typical RSC use case, the plugin might be configured as in the following example:

vite.config.ts

export

 

default

 

defineConfig

(

{

  

plugins

:

 [

    

cloudflare

(

{

      

viteEnvironment

:

 

{

        

name

:

 

"rsc"

,

        

childEnvironments

:

 [

"ssr"

]

,

      

},

    

}

)

,

  

]

,

}

)

;

@vitejs/plugin-rsc
 provides the lower level functionality that frameworks, such as 
React Router
 ↗

, build upon.
The GitHub repository includes a 
basic Cloudflare example

 JSON output for `wrangler whoami` 
 
 
 
 
Workers
 
 
 
 
The 
wrangler whoami
 command now supports a 
--json
 flag for machine-readable output. This makes it easy to check authentication status in shell scripts without parsing text output.

When authenticated, the command outputs a JSON object containing your auth type, email, accounts, and token permissions. When not authenticated, it outputs 
{"loggedIn": false}
 and exits with a non-zero status code.

# Check if authenticated

 Agents SDK v0.4.0: Readonly connections, MCP security improvements, x402 v2 migration, and custom MCP OAuth providers 
 
 
 
 
Agents
 

 
Workers
 
 
 
 
The latest release of the 
Agents SDK
 ↗

 brings readonly connections, MCP protocol and security improvements, x402 payment protocol v2 migration, and the ability to customize OAuth for MCP server connections.

Readonly connections

Agents can now restrict WebSocket clients to read-only access, preventing them from modifying agent state. This is useful for dashboards, spectator views, or any scenario where clients should observe but not mutate.

New hooks: 
shouldConnectionBeReadonly
, 
setConnectionReadonly
, 
isConnectionReadonly
. Readonly connections block both client-side 
setState()
 and mutating 
@callable()
 methods, and the readonly flag survives hibernation.

Custom MCP OAuth providers

You can also set up 
1.1.1.1 for Families
 for an added layer of protection on your home network against malware and adult content. 1.1.1.1 for Families leverages Cloudflare's global network to ensure that it is fast and secure around the world, and includes the same 
strong privacy guarantees
 that Cloudflare committed to when launching 1.1.1.1.

1.1.1.1 for Families

1.1.1.1 for Families categorizes destinations on the Internet based on the potential threat they pose regarding malware, phishing, or other types of security risks.

1.1.1.1 for Families has two default options:

 

Block malware

 
Use the following DNS resolvers to block malicious content:

1.1.1.2

1.0.0.2

2606:4700:4700::1112

2606:4700:4700::1002

 

 

Block malware and adult content

 
Use the following DNS resolvers to block malware and adult content:

1.1.1.3

1.0.0.3

2606:4700:4700::1113

2606:4700:4700::1003

 

Cloudflare returns 
0.0.0.0
 if the 
fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
 ↗

 or IP in a DNS query is classified as malicious.

Domain miscategorization

If you are using 1.1.1.1 for Families and see a domain that you believe is miscategorized, 
fill in this form
 ↗

 to bring it to our attention. Your submission will remain anonymous.

We review these submissions to improve Cloudflare’s categorization.

Test 1.1.1.1 for Families

After configuring 1.1.1.1 for Families, you can test if it is working as intended with the following URLs:

https://malware.testcategory.com/
 ↗

https://nudity.testcategory.com/
 ↗

: Use this to test if 1.1.1.1 for Families is blocking known adult content and malware addresses correctly.

DNS over HTTPS (DoH)

If you have a DoH-compliant client, such as a compatible router, you can set up 1.1.1.1 for Families to encrypt your DNS queries over HTTPS. This prevents spoofing and tracking by malicious actors, advertisers, ISPs, and others. For more information on DoH, refer to the 
Learning Center article on DNS encryption
 ↗

Create AI-powered search for your data
 

 Available on all plans 

AI Search (formerly AutoRAG) is Cloudflare’s managed search service. You can connect your data such as websites or unstructured content, and it automatically creates a continuously updating index that you can query with natural language in your applications or AI agents. It natively integrates with Cloudflare’s developer platform tools like Vectorize, AI Gateway, R2, and Workers AI, while also supporting third-party providers and open standards.

It supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns, enabling you to build enterprise search, natural language search, and AI-powered chat without managing infrastructure.

Build full-stack AI applications with Vectorize, Cloudflare's powerful vector database.
 

Vectorize is a globally distributed vector database that enables you to build full-stack, AI-powered applications with 
Cloudflare Workers
. Vectorize makes querying embeddings — representations of values or objects like text, images, audio that are designed to be consumed by machine learning models and semantic search algorithms — faster, easier and more affordable.

Vectorize is now Generally Available

To report bugs or give feedback, go to the 
#vectorize Discord channel
 ↗

. If you are having issues with Wrangler, report issues in the 
Wrangler GitHub repository

.

For example, by storing the embeddings (vectors) generated by a machine learning model, including those built-in to 
Workers AI
 or by bringing your own from platforms like 
OpenAI
, you can build applications with powerful search, similarity, recommendation, classification and/or anomaly detection capabilities based on your own data.

The vectors returned can reference images stored in Cloudflare R2, documents in KV, and/or user profiles stored in D1 — enabling you to go from vector search result to concrete object all within the Workers platform, and without standing up additional infrastructure.

Cloudflare Access determines who can reach your application by applying the Access policies you configure.

An Access policy consists of an 
Action
 as well as rules which determine the scope of the action. To build a rule, you need to choose a 
Rule type
, 
Selector
, and a 
Value
 for the selector.

Actions

Rule types

Selectors

Actions

Actions let you grant or deny permission to a certain user or user group. You can set only one action per policy.

Allow

The Allow action allows users that meet certain criteria to reach an application behind Access.

The following example lets any user with an 
@example.com
 email address, as validated against an IdP, reach the application:

Action

Rule type

Selector

Value

Allow

Include

Emails Ending In:

@example.com

You can add a Require rule in the same policy action to enforce additional checks. Finally, if the policy contains an Exclude rule, users meeting that definition are prevented from reaching the application.

For example, this second configuration lets any user from Portugal with a 
@team.com
 email address, as validated against an IdP, reach the application, except for 
user-1
 and 
user-2
:

Action

Rule type

Selector

Value

Allow

Include

Country

Portugal

Require

Emails Ending In

@team.com

Exclude

Email

user-1@team.com
, 
user-2@team.com

Block

The Block action prevents users who meet certain critera from reaching an application behind Access. For example, the following policy blocks requests from Russian source IPs that are not on your 
list of approved IPs
.

Action

Rule type

Selector

Value

Block

Include

Country

Russian Federation

Exclude

IP list

Corporate IP allowlist

Block policies are best used in conjunction with 
Allow policies
 as a way to carve out exceptions in those Allow policies. Since Access is deny by default, users who do not match a Block policy will still be denied access unless they explicitly match an Allow policy.

Bypass

Warning

Bypass does not enforce any Access security controls and requests are not logged. Bypass policies should be tested before deploying to production. Consider using 
Service Auth
 if you would like to enforce policies and maintain logging without requiring user authentication.

As Bypass does not enforce Access security controls, Bypass policies do not support identity-based 
rule types
. When making Bypass policies, you will not be able to apply certain identity-based 
selectors
 (such as email).

The Bypass action disables any Access enforcement for traffic that meets the defined rule criteria. Bypass is typically used to enable applications that require specific endpoints to be public.

For example, some applications have an endpoint under the 
/admin
 route that must be publicly routable. In this situation, you could create an Access application for the domain 
test.example.com/admin/&#x3C;your-url>
 and add the following Bypass policy:

Action

Rule type

Selector

Value

Bypass

Include

Everyone

Everyone

As part of implementing a Zero Trust security model, Cloudflare does not recommend using Bypass to grant direct permanent access to your internal applications. To enable seamless and secure access for on-network employees, use Cloudflare Tunnel to 
connect your private network
 and have users connect through WARP.

Note

When applying a Bypass action, security settings revert to the defaults configured for the zone and any configured Page Rules. If 
Always use HTTPS
 is enabled for the site, then traffic to the bypassed destination continues in HTTPS. If 
Always use HTTPS
 is disabled, traffic is HTTP.

Bypass policies which contain 
WARP device posture check

Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP — instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (
cloudflared
) creates 
outbound-only connections
 to Cloudflare's global network. Cloudflare Tunnel can connect HTTP web servers, 
SSH servers
, 
remote desktops
, and other protocols safely to Cloudflare. This way, your origins can serve traffic through Cloudflare without being vulnerable to attacks that bypass Cloudflare.

Refer to our 
reference architecture
 for details on how to implement Cloudflare Tunnel into your existing infrastructure.

 
 
 

 
   
 
  

How it works

Cloudflared establishes 
outbound connections
 (tunnels) between your resources and Cloudflare's global network. Tunnels are persistent objects that route traffic to DNS records. Within the same tunnel, you can run as many 'cloudflared' processes (connectors) as needed. These processes will establish connections to Cloudflare and send traffic to the nearest Cloudflare data center.

Outbound-only connection

Cloudflare Tunnel uses an outbound-only connection model to enable bidirectional communication. When you install and run 
cloudflared
, 
cloudflared
 initiates an outbound connection through your firewall from the origin to the Cloudflare global network.

Once the connection is established, traffic flows in both directions over the tunnel between your origin and Cloudflare. Most firewalls allow outbound traffic by default. 
cloudflared
 takes advantage of this standard by connecting out to the Cloudflare network from the server you installed 
cloudflared
 on. You can then configure your firewall to allow only these outbound connections and block all inbound traffic, effectively blocking access to your origin from anything other than Cloudflare. This setup ensures that all traffic to your origin is securely routed through the tunnel.

Next steps

Create a tunnel using the 
Cloudflare dashboard
 or 
API
.

Learn more about 

cloudflared

, the server-side daemon that connects your infrastructure to Cloudflare.

Review useful 
Tunnel terms
 to familiarize yourself with the concepts used in Tunnel documentation.

Troubleshoot
 your Tunnel by reviewing available logs and common errors.

Cloudflare Gateway, our comprehensive 
Secure Web Gateway
 ↗

, allows you to set up policies to inspect DNS, Network, HTTP, and Egress traffic.

Packet filtering
 inspects and filters unwanted traffic based on packet attributes. Packet filtering policies block threats regardless of user or session context.

DNS policies
 inspect DNS queries. You can block domains and IP addresses from resolving on your devices. For more information on DNS filtering, refer to our 
Learning Center article
 ↗

.

Network policies
 inspect individual TCP/UDP/GRE packets. You can block access to specific ports on your origin server, including non-HTTP resources.

HTTP policies
 inspect HTTP requests. You can block specific URLs from loading, not just the domain itself. For more information on URL filtering, refer to our 
Learning Center article
 ↗

.

Egress policies
 inspect traffic to assign egress IP addresses unique to your organization.

Resolver policies
 inspect DNS queries to enable resolution by custom authoritative nameservers.

Note

When creating or editing policies, it may take up to 60 seconds for that policy to be updated across all of Cloudflare's data centers.

 
 
 

 
   
 
  

Best practices

For each type of policy, we recommend the following workflow:

Connect the devices and/or networks that you want to apply policies to.

Verify that Gateway is successfully proxying traffic from your devices.

Set up basic security and compatibility policies (recommended for most use cases).

Customize your configuration to the unique needs of your organization.

To get started with specific Gateway filtering types, refer to the initial setup for 
DNS
, 
Network
, and 
HTTP
 policies.

Select a policy type

The recommended policy type depends on what kind of traffic you are trying to filter. For example:

To block websites, create an HTTP policy.

To block non-HTTP traffic such as SSH and RDP, create a Network policy.

To block malware and other security threats, create both DNS and HTTP policies.

To assign static IP addresses to your organization's egress traffic, create an egress policy.

Refer to the 
Packet filtering
, 
DNS
, 
Network
, 
HTTP
, and 
egress
 configuration pages to see the available filtering options within each policy builder.

 solutions by executing active webpage content in a secure isolated browser. Executing active content remotely from the endpoint protects users from zero-day attacks and malware. In addition to protecting endpoints, Browser Isolation also protects users from phishing attacks by preventing user input on risky websites and controlling data transmission to sensitive web applications. You can further filter isolated traffic with Gateway 
HTTP
 and
